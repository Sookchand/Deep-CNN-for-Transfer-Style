#  Deep CNN model for Style Transfer"
This is a solution to the problem of creating an artistic image using a style transfer technique. The technique used is a combination of convolutional neural networks and a pre-trained VGG19 model. The style image is used to transfer the style of the image to the base image. The base image is then preprocessed and the style image is preprocessed. The combination image is then created by combining the preprocessed base image and the preprocessed style image. The combination image is then optimized using the VGG19 model and the style transfer technique. The resulting image is then visualized.
